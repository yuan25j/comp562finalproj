# COMP 562 Final Project

Traffic collisions are an immensely import area of societal concern. In 2020 and in the U.S. alone, there were 35,766 fatal car crashes and another 1,593,390 crashes resulted in injury (Bieber, 2023).  Our project utilized collision data for the city of Seattle that is updated weekly by the Seattle Department of Transportation to employ machine learning methods. We utilized logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree models that were trained using information regarding the weather condition, relation to intersections, road conditions, light conditions, and if the driver was under the influence variables to predict whether or not the collision resulted in an injury. Our findings found that there was a strong correlation between these variables and whether or not an injury was sustained. Consequently, our work has significant implications for traffic and road planning as well as policies regarding alcohol use and driving.
